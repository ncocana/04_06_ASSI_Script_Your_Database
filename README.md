## Introduction

In this assignment, we had to create a serie of scripts to generate the database we did in a relational diagram in an anterior assignment. If possible, using the following keywords:  

```
IF NOT EXISTS
PRIMARY KEY
FOREIGN KEY
NOT NULL
CHECK
UNIQUE KEY
AUTO_INCREMENT
```

This assignment was made by [Noa Coca√±a](https://github.com/ncocana) and [Samuel Piedra](https://github.com/SPiedra955).

## Scripts

### ddl.sql

This script creates the database and its tables, in which we define what find of data can be inserted in them.

Example:

* Creating the databases 'rentalBikes':

* Creating the table 'Stock':

### dml.sql

Once the database is created, with this script we can insert some data with which we'll proceed later on to make some example queries.

Example:

### queries.sql

This file contains some examples of queries to get the wanted data from the tables.

Example:

### delete.sql

Like his own name, describes this script is for deleting data from the tables. However, this doesn't delete the table, only the data in it.

Example:

* Deleting the data inside the table 'Bikes':

* Checking the table's data, as you can see the table 'Bikes' still exists but without the data previously stored in it.

### drop.sql

In this script, the database's tables are erased completely. Before deleting the tables, we deactivated the foreign keys with the purpose of avoiding errors.

Example:
